<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
	Hello, my name is Tim and I am an aspiring Web Developer. This is my website created for people who want to learn a bit more about me.
	<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp I grew up in the city of Dearborn, in Southeast Michigan - Metro Detroit. Over the past two years, 
	I have gained a great deal of knowledge in the field of information technology, specifically, web development. Through my educational experience at Henry Ford College, 
	I have acquired additional skill sets by being exposed to various facets of the information technology industry, such as object-oriented programming, social media, and networking. During my time at Henry Ford College, I also gained experience in the industry through a co-op as a junior web developer.  
	My second co-op was in the summer of 2016 for a local voice over Internet protocol start-up that focused more on information technology. 
	Both opportunities have been extremely rewarding for me as I grew both personally and professionally. 
	<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp My journey into the world of information technology has been a long one. Please take some time to cruise through my information. I hope you enjoy my site as much as I have enjoyed making it.
