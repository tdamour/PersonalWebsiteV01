	    <h2>Drawing</h2>
	    <p>
		 It brings relief and calm when I take up a pencil and a sketchbook. I love drawing because it lets me create different worlds full of characters with futures, presents, pasts, gadgets, and plots twists to beat the band. I can create a mess when I do this as I am limited only by a never-ending imagination.

	    <h2>Sports</h2>
	    <p>
		 Whenever I am feeling out of sorts, stressed, or just plain out of shape, I try to run, lift a few pounds overhead, or just bench and curl. I also love to play basketball, or any other games with friends. But don't me wrong, I also just like to chill and watch a game too.

		  <h2>Traveling</h2>
	      <p>
			Even though I'm not the most well traveled person, I will take the chance whenever I can to travel somewhere new. Whether it's Hilton Head, Chicago, or Las Vegas, it's always a good time to see new places and learn.

		  <h2>Reading</h2>
	      <p>
		   This activity always sharpens my mind, either rationally or creatively, depending on the subject matter. Whether it's reading for information about a new skill, reading about stories of people from the past or reading a fictional tale, this activity brings out different perspectives and narratives that make me think uniquely about the world. It is a very relaxing activity for me.
